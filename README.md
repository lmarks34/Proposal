# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

	Schwarbot



## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

	A Twitter bot that automatically publishes a tweet when Phillies outfielder Kyle Schwarber hits a homerun (Schwarbomb).

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
	
	Our project’s main focus is to create a Twitter bot using Twitter API that will connect to live stats from the MLB website in order to produce tweets about live situations. The twitter bot will send out a tweet whenever Kyle Schwarber, Philadelphia Phillies outfielder, hits a Home Run. Our intended goal will be for the tweet to also include the live score of the game and the inning. The best possible outcome for our bot will be to allow you to specify which player you would like to receive home run updates for.
	

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

	N/A


## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

	Ray Mele, tuk82869@temple.edu, Section 2 TA: Rahad Nabid
	Logan Marks,tul53733@temple.edu,Section 3 TA: Xinwen Zhang
	Dean DiPaolo,tuj94338@temple.edu, Section 2 TA: Rahad Nabid



## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

	Twitter Bot will send a tweet when a home run is hit. It will post a specified phrase stating that Kyle Schwarber hit his “n” th home run in whatever game they are playing in whatever inning they are in.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

	TwitterBot will show the current score of the game and what inning it currently is.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

	Twitter Bot will let users pick any MLB player and send homerun alerts for that player. It could also allow the user to look up other analytics like RBIs, On base percentage, slugging, etc.
 
## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Next steps will look as follows:
New Skills?
Learn about Twitter API process, use, and syntax
Learn how to access websites and their information
Learn how to export that information into a tweet
Topics?
Twitter API
Python web crawling
More advanced importing

	Each classmate will be responsible for learning all of the above so we can each equally contribute to the program.
